              <P>
                With technology, we are often persuaded to keep clicking, scrolling, and sharing, whether we realise it or not.
              </P>
              <P>
                But the posts and articles that keep us most engaged are affecting our perspective on the world, and how we all get along.
              </P>
              <P>
                We need to fix that.

              To solve any problem, we must first start with discussion to understand different perspectives
              and offer fresh ideas. HTA is dedicated to creating constructive conversations, not adversarial
              debates. We understand the value of listening to different perspectives, and not talking to
              'be right' or impress others.
            </P>
            <P>We have three streams of activity:</P>
            <T h3>1. Educating the public</T>
            <P>
              The more people who understand the nature and severity of the attention economy, the better we will be able to manage our relationship with technology.
            </P>
            <P>
              The issues are complex and at times can be technical, which is why it's vital there are straight-forward resources and open discussion opportunities available to help make better sense of things.
            </P>
            <T h3>2. Empowering technologists</T>
            <P>
              Technology companies are made up of employees, each of whom live in the world that is being reshaped by technology.  By educating those who are building technology in the outcomes of ethical design research, we can start an informed conversation.
            </P>
            <P>
              When technologists are empowered to voice their values and concerns not only as an employee but as a member of the community, the company's products, strategy and internal culture can be guided more holistically.
            </P>
            <T h3>3. Cultivating conversation</T>
            <P>
              Technology and policy have traditionally been developed at arm's length.  HTA believes a better reciprocal understanding between legislators, technology leaders, sociologists and psychologists will help work towards a shared bigger picture.
            </P>
            <P>
              We do this by bringing together the best minds from a variety of fields to share insights and foster discussion through roundtables and think tank events.

              We’re just a handful of people who believe that in order to live in a thriving, cooperative society,
              we need to re-examine our relationship with technology.
